Hi, how are you doing guys? I'm currently learning development of blogs and static website in the Jekyll. I love how simple this looks, or maybe after development in Django, I'm not getting overwhelmed by the development in this. So, create this OpenBlog where the developers can share their experience, from ***noobs*** to ***pro***, just share with world whatever you want to share.

I'm working on the documentation, so anyone can understand the use case of this development.

For the guys who want to post but have no idea about what to do. Just go to the repo, and look into the **post** folder, and create a file with the same syntax, but for real keep the file name different, put author as your name, and done!

I'll be adding Twitter, GitHub and Instagram handle in each of the posts so that the readers can contact you awesomely!.

Thanks for going through the lousy welcome.
